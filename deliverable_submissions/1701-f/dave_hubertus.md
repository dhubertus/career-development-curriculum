       [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@dhubertus/first-dive-into-an-open-source-project-56cc4635369f) </br>
     Writing a blog post about my first dive into an open source project provides a great opportunity to show my passion for programming as well as my ability to synthesize information even when completely foreign to my current skill set. I described, to the best of my ability, the overwhelming feeling of jumping into a large foreign code base as a junior developer, and the methods in which I chose to break down the problem at hand into more digestible pieces. Hopefully this post will also help other junior developers who also find themselves feeling overwhelmed to take a few steps back and use the knowledge they do possess to break down unfamiliar issues.</br>
